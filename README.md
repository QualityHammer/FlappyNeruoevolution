# FlappyNeruoevolution

A Flappy Bird clone I made along with a neuroevolution library to play the game. Heavily inspired by [Code Bullet](https://github.com/Code-Bullet), but special shoutout to [The Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain) for having an amazing series of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7MdSCaIfsxc561QI0U0Tb) that are great resources to learn the basic machine learning concepts in a more interesting and intuitive way than many others.
